# Guidelines for authoring posts

MachingGurning.com makes use of the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme, and so additional documentation on this theme can be found [here](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).

## Instructions for authoring

* Author a post as normal using RStudio in `.Rmd` format and save in _rmd/
* Files should be named date first in the format: `2016-03-12-a_blog_post.Rmd` (note that it must be `2016-03-12-...` not `2016-03-12_...` -- **this will not work**). All associated files should be prefixed with the same date (e.g. data or figures; to achieve the latter, you must ensure that every figure producing R chunk is named appropriately, e.g. `{r 2016-03-12_image_producing_code}`).
* Drafts should be completed in the `dev` branch, and multiple commits rebased in the to `master` branch so that each new post is based on just a single commit (at first).
* All data should be saved in `data/`, and all figures/images saved in `figures/` **Do not save anything in `_data/`: this will cause a build failure when uplaoding to github**
* Look at a previous post and copy the YAML header for consistency. Pay particular attention to the categories. Posts predominantly written in R should be categorised as Rstats. This is to ensure the post is picked up by the correct feed for sites like RBloggers (we still need to register as of 2016-03-12).
* When authoring a post in Rstudio you will need to adjust links to `../_data/myfile.csv` to find relevant files, as the compilation process will begin from `_rmd`. The final version commited to github should take machinegurning.github.io/ to be the base dir. with all links relative to this (i.e. for data: `_data/mydata.csv`).
* Each post should be completely reproducible. Shrink data using `.Rds` format as required, and include a session info at the end of each post. Reproducibility tools such as `checkpoint::checkpoint()` are to be encouraged.

## Compiling

* Install the package rmd2md (<https://github.com/ivyleavedtoadflax/rmd2md>) with the command `devtools::install_github('ivyleavedtoadflax/rmd2md').` This package replaces the rmd2md.R script, and will convert `.Rmd` files to `.md` format for use with  jekyll and particularly github pages.
* Run `sudo Rscript -e rmd2md::rmd2md()` from base dir (on linux) or open an R session, setting the root directory to be the same as the root of this repository, then run `rmd2md::rmd2md()`. This will:
    * compile the Rmd into a github acceptable format saved in `_posts/`
    * remove exifs from jpegs saved in `figures/`
* Add the newly created *.md* file to the repository using `git add`.
* Be sure to changed the status to `status: processed` to ensure that this `.Rmd` is not continually compiled - *This is not currently handled automatically, but will be in future*.
* Be sure to add all related files (e.g. data and especially figures).
* Create a new branch of the format `post/name_of_post` using `git checkout -b post/name_of_post`.
* Squash new commits down to a single commit using `git rebase -i HEAD~n` where n is the number of commits created in the process of writing the new post. Be careful here if you don't know what you are doing!
* Rebase the master branch into the new post branch with `git checkout post/name_of_post; git rebase master`.
* Rebase the new post on to the master branch with `git checkout master; git rebase post/name_of_post`, dealign with any conflicts as they arise.
* Push the data to the machinegurning repository on the master branch, ideall y as just a single commit.

## Other things

* svg format is preferable: use `dev="svg"` in chunk options. Very large images with many many poitns should be rendered as png to avoid slow loading.
* Large figures should be posted as links to raw image file in github. This can be achieved automatically using `sed`. For example `[Image 1](figures/image1.svg)` should become `![(Image 1](figures/image1.svg)](figures/image1.svg)`. This change needs to made in the raw .md document. Be aware that future changes to the Rmd will overwrite this. Something like this may help:
* Use `$$ a + b $$` and `$ a + b $` for math blocks and inline math respectively.
```
# To find relevant figure links:

grep "\s\[(.*?)\]\(.*?\)\s" -E *.md 

```
* Use a consistent style; [this](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) is a good place to start!
