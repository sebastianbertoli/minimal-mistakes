# Projects

## CORAL a collaborative robotic assistant learner

![jpg](/assets/images/projects/coral_teaser.jpg)

The CORAL demonstrator was developed in June 2018 at Fraunhofer Italy. I
co-developed the machine learning module that learns a sorting task and sends
the results to the Franka Emika roboter pictured. Code samples are available
upon request.

## Predictive maintenance for the manufacturing industry

As part of the EU-funded research project PreMain I conducted two feasibility
studies where I analysed the potential of machine learning for doing predictive
maintenance. I was responsible for all data science related tasks: from
gathering the data and running the machine learning experiments to writing up
and presenting the results. Code samples are available upon request.

## Extracting destinations from GPS data

This project was carried out during my summer 2017 internship at the Bruno
Kessler foundation. The goal was to implement a fast algorithm that could
extract destinations (places where people stay) from GPS data. If you would
like to run to explore the demo interactively please check out the GitHub
repository.
