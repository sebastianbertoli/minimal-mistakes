# Projects

## CORAL a collaborative robotic assistant learner

![jpg](/assets/images/projects/coral_teaser.jpg)

This demonstrator was developed in June 2018 while working at Fraunhofer Italy. I co-developed the machine learning module that learns a sorting task and sends the results to the Franka Emika roboter pictured. The full setup is described in the following German magazine article: [Kollaborative Robotik â€“ Maschinelles Lernen durch Imitation](https://www.industrie40-management.de/node/275). Code samples are available upon request.

## Extracting destinations from GPS data

This project was carried out during my summer 2017 internship at the Bruno Kessler foundation. The goal was to implement a fast algorithm that could
extract destinations (places where people stay) from GPS data. On the blog I have posted [a static demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-11-human-mobility %}) of the Jupyter Notebook. If you would like to run to explore the demo interactively please check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sebastianbertoli/Github-internship_human_mobility).

## Predictive maintenance for the manufacturing industry

As part of the EU-funded research project [PreMain](https://www.fraunhofer.it/de/leistungsangebot/automation-und-mechatronics-engineering/premain.html) I conducted two feasibility studies betwee where I analysed the potential of machine learning for doing predictive maintenance. I was responsible for all data science related tasks: from gathering the data and running the machine learning experiments to writing up and presenting the results. Code samples are available upon request.
