# Projects

## Extracting destinations from GPS data.

This project contains a fast Python implementation of algorithms
proposed in [[1]](#hariharan2004) to extract so-called stop locations
from GPS data. The project also contains some sample data and a
detailed Jupyter notebook that showcases the work. You can preview the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sebastianbertoli/Github-internship_human_mobility/blob/master/Notebook%20for%20github%20latest%20edition.ipynb).
