MachineGurning.com is a blog by two Data Scientists.

## Matt Gregory

A public-sector data scientist and player of games with a background in the biological sciences and education. Iâ€™m keen to explore data and to use cutting-edge statistical techniques, including Machine Learning algorithms, to make reproducible, robust and actionable insights from the data.



## Matt Upson

Bona-fide data geek with a PhD in Environmental Science, and an interest in Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and all things IoT. Working as a Data Scientist in the public sector.

I'm all open source tools like R and Python, and reproducible research using Jupyter and knitr. Wrote my PhD in $\\LaTeX$. Wedded to Linux. Increasingly using NoSQL, and working in the cloud.
