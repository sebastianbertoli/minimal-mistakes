It's a new year, it's a new dawn and I have a new website! [Static](https://jekyllrb.com/), [fast](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsebastianbertoli.github.io%2F&tab=desktop) and [free](https://pages.github.com/). It's still early days so expect content to be added and looks to change. Theme by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/).

Cheers!
