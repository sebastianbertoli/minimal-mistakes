Last week [Matt G](https://twitter.com/mammykins_) tweeted about a quick blog post I wrote about [iteratively applying models](../iterating/) using some of Hadley's packages, to which Hadley replied:
 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mammykins_">@mammykins_</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/m_a_upson">@m_a_upson</a> the only thing it&#39;s missing is that you should store related data frames and models as list columns of s data frame</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/716284174076747777">April 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

Now this blog is pretty new, and we haven't made much of an effort to promote it.
In the time since I transferred from the old domain name (more on this later) pretty much no-one has been looking at it (apart from my mum -- thanks mum).
 
So what happens when Hadley reads your blog post and mentions it on twitter?
 
## Quantifying the Hadley effect
 
Well, taking the true **Hadley Effect** to be a single day event ocurring 2nd April (we term the tail of this spike: residual Hadley Effect): it's around a **7000% increase** in unique daily visits.

## A bit more data
 
So this isn't the whole story.
I've been blogging since the end of 2014 (although I only signed up to Google Analytics in April 2015), and used to host this all using github pages (actually we are still hosted by github pages: <https://machinegurning.github.io>, just we bought a err more sensible domain). So I've actually got a bit more data with which to evaluate the Hadley effect.
 
From a quick glance, it seems that not only is a mention from Hadley worth about 3 times as many reads as my most popular article (seems to be [this]("../cycling-weather/") one); but his briefest of mentions convinces people to read more of the blog for longer! -- Thanks Hadley
