In my [last post](../esp8266) I started meddling with the ESP8266 module as a low
cost (and smaller) alternative to an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for creating home
sensors.
 
I was toying with the idea of sending measurements to a database using a RESTful
API on the existing Postgres database I use to host measurements on Amazon Web
Services.
 
After a bit of reading, I've realised that there is a better solution:
[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), a lightweight protocol designed for machine to machine
(M2M) communication for sensors, and similar low powered and simple devices. 
MQTT uses an event driven publish/subscribe paradigm: sensors publish to a
broker, which can then pass on information to subscribers. I'm not 100% sure yet
how I will achieve persistence (and store sensor readings for later analysis),
[HiveMQ](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-mqtt) has a plugin
that will do this at the broker, without the database needing to be a
subscriber, which is a nice option.
 
MQTT looks like the way forward for this kind of project, so I'll worry about
the persistence problem later.
 
### Minibian: a lightweight Raspberry Pi distro
 
I've got a spare Raspberry Pi 2 which I am using for this project. To save
space, and avoid raspbian bloat, I've used
[minibian](https://minibianpi.wordpress.com/features/) for a very lightweight
machine.
 
#### Creating a user
 
You'll also realise pretty quickly that the usual Raspberry Pi user setup is not
there in Minibian. There is just a root user, so I first created a new user with
admin privileges:
 
``` 
adduser <newuser>
 
sudo usermod -a -G sudo <newuser> 
```
 
You may then also want to get access to the `sudo` command. So you will need to
log into the superuser account, and install it.
 
``` 
# Log in as root (assuming you are logged in as newuser)
 
su
 
# Install sudo
 
apt-get install sudo 
``` 
 
#### Upgrading
 
The last release of Minibian was 2015-11-12, so a good thing to do is update the
few packages that do come installed to the latest versions:
 
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y 
```
 
#### Wi-Fi drivers
 
Minibian is so lightweight it doesn't ship with Wi-Fi drivers as standard. If
you want to use Wi-Fi instead of a wired connection, you will need to install
these manually. An explanation is given
[here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=108863), but in
brief:
 
```
# Install necessary packages
 
apt-get install firmware-ralink 
apt-get install firmware-realtek
 
# Test with a network scan
 
apt-get install wireless-tools iwlist wlan0 scan
 
# Install wpa_supplicant for auto-connect
 
apt-get install wpasupplicant
 
```
 
I usually just copy the `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` file from
another one of my pis, to duplicate the Wi-Fi settings. My `wpa_supplicant.conf`
looks something like this:
 
``` 
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
 
network={
         ssid="SSID"
         psk="password"
         proto=RSN
         key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
         pairwise=CCMP
         auth_alg=OPEN
        }
 
```
 
#### Using SSH keys
 
Finally I want to avoid entering a password every time I log on, so I copy the
public SSH key from my laptop to the `authorized_keys` file on the minibian pi.
 
If you want to use git or similar, you will need to generate an SSH key for the
pi, so you may as well run `ssh-keygen` now, and generate a key. For internal
network use, I tend to leave the passwords blank, but if you are particularly
security conscious, you can enter something.
 
This command will create the `~/.ssh/` folder. The next step is to send over
your public key from your client machine. I do this without copying pasting with
the following command run from the client machine:
 
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@192.168.1.100 'cat >>
~/.ssh/authorized_keys' 
```
 
You'll be prompted to enter your password for this
command, but after that, you should not have to enter a password again, the next
time you SSH in.
 
## Creating a disk image
 
After all this work, it's a good idea to create a backup disk image. Thankfully
a Minibian image can be nice and small, unlike the standard raspbian, so you are
not left with several GB sized files all over the place.
 
First you need to unmount the drive with `umount`. It will be mounted in two
places on `/media/user/`, so make sure to `umount` both.
 
Then you can run:
 
``` 
sudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=2016-02-15-minibian.img 
```  
to create a backup image and compress it.
This will produce an 8GB file (depending on the size of your SD card, and with a lot of blank space).
We can check this with `fdisk -l /tmp/2016-02-15-minibian.img` which gives:
 
```
Disk /tmp/2016-02-15-minibian.img: 7744 MB, 7744782336 bytes
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 236352 cylinders, total 15126528 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x0008929a
 
                   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/tmp/2016-02-15-minibian1              16      125055       62520    b  W95 FAT32
/tmp/2016-02-15-minibian2          125056    14997503     7436224   83  Linux
 
```
We can then take the block size (1 * 512) and the end of the second partition (14997503), and truncate the end of the image with:
 
```
 truncate --size=$[(14997503+1)*512] /tmp/2016-02-15-minibian
```
 
and then compress the final image with:
 
```
bzip2 /tmp/2016-02-15-minibian.img
```
 
## Next steps
 
Next time I'll install the MQTT broker...
