One of the projects I have been involved in at Fraunhofe is CORAL - a
self-learning collaborative robotic assistant". The purpose of CORAL is to
bring concepts commonly associated with Industry 4.0 to live by showcasing
their appplicability to a small-scale industrial environment. In particular, we
take the idea of automation one step further and implement a system that is
inherently collaborative and flexible.

Concretely, it means that our system learns to carry out a pre defined task by
demonstration alone. After a brief learning phase and once the system is
confident enough it will carry out the task autonomously. The task in question
is to sort coloured wooden cubes as demonstrated by a human operator.

In the picture below we can see an overview of the setup.
